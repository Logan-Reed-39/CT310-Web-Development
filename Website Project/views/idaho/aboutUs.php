        This is Maxwell, a junior studying Computer Science at Colorado State University. In his free time, he likes to explore. Some common activities he enjoys are hiking a new trail, traveling to different countries, perusing the recommendations on Netflix, or trying new foods. The Matterhorn is at the top of the list of mountains he would like to visit. As to why he wrote this in third person, who knows. He was too tired at the end of this project to notice.
